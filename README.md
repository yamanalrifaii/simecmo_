# SimECMO 

SimECMO is a web-based, interactive simulation platform designed to train healthcare professionals in Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) management. The platform integrates machine learning models trained on physiological data to predict patient responses to parameter adjustments. Through scenario-based learning modules covering oxygenation, hemodynamics, cardiovascular function, and ECMO circuit parameters, users can explore complex relationships between variables and receive AI-driven clinical interpretations of their interventions.

SimECMO was developed under the supervision of several medical doctors from the United States and the United Arab Emirates.
