// # Acute Heart Failure Scenario

// ## Introduction

// Welcome to the Acute Heart Failure scenario in our ECMO Simulation Platform. In this simulation, you will face the challenging case of a patient experiencing acute heart failure, a critical condition that requires swift and precise intervention.

// ### Patient Overview:
// You are about to meet Sarah Thompson, a 62-year-old woman who has been rushed to the emergency department with severe shortness of breath, chest pain, and signs of circulatory collapse. Sarah has a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease, and she recently underwent a coronary stent placement.

// ### Initial Presentation:
// - Extreme dyspnea at rest
// - Tachycardia with a heart rate of 120 bpm
// - Blood pressure: 85/50 mmHg
// - Oxygen saturation: 88% on room air
// - Widespread crackles on lung auscultation
// - Elevated jugular venous pressure
// - Cool, clammy extremities

// ### Your Challenge:
// As the attending physician, your task is to:
// 1. Rapidly assess the patient's condition
// 2. Initiate appropriate medical management
// 3. Determine if ECMO support is necessary
// 4. If ECMO is indicated, select the appropriate configuration and manage the patient on ECMO support

// Throughout this simulation, you will need to make critical decisions regarding fluid management, pharmacological interventions, and mechanical circulatory support. Your choices will directly impact the patient's outcome.

// Remember, time is of the essence in acute heart failure. Every decision you make can significantly affect Sarah's chances of survival and recovery.

// Are you ready to begin this high-stakes medical scenario? Your expertise and quick thinking could save Sarah's life. Good luck!
